<p>i wasn't ashamed of loving you</p>

<p>but<br>
though i didn't feel it<br>
i knew it</p>

<p>that emptiness is subsuming</p>

<p>or, is it comforting?</p>

<p>i remember laughing<br>
i remember staring<br>
i remember feeling held</p>

<p>and adrift</p>

<p>was this hard because love is hard?<br>
did i mistake work for worth?</p>

<p>i felt drained when we were together<br>
withered when we were apart</p>

<p>will I feel this forever?<br>
does everyone?<br>
would it matter?</p>

<p>you weren't giving me drugs<br>
weren't giving me liquor<br>
weren't giving me sex</p>

<p>yet you were destructive</p>

<p>yet i loved you</p>

<p>you weren't ashamed of loving me</p>

<p>but<br>
though you didn't feel it<br>
you knew it</p>

<p>we consumed each other<br>
but weren't sated</p>

<p>we just destroyed</p>
