<p>I can't imagine being ashamed<br>
of loving someone</p>

<p>But though I don't feel it<br>
I know it</p>

<p>That disconnect is hard to sit with</p>

<p>Or, is it easy?</p>

<p>I remember laughing<br>
I remember staring<br>
I remember feeling safe</p>

<p>And anxious</p>

<p>Was this hard because love is hard<br>
or because you and I don't fit?</p>

<p>I felt exhausted while I spent time with you<br>
I felt exhausted after I left you</p>

<p>Will I feel this forever?<br>
Does everyone?<br>
Does that matter?</p>

<p>You weren't giving me drugs<br>
weren't giving me liquor<br>
weren't giving me sex</p>

<p>Yet you were destructive</p>

<p>Yet I loved you</p>

<p>Shame</p>

<p>You can't imagine being ashamed<br>
of loving someone</p>

<p>But though you don't feel it<br>
You know it</p>

<p>We took from each other<br>
but we gained nothing</p>

<p>We just destroyed</p>
